# Timelapser

To be used with a raspberrypi (I'm using raspberrypi 2, model b) with an USB cam connected to it (I'm using Logitech, Inc. HD Pro Webcam C920). 
It sets up an raspberry pi to take picture every 5th minute.

Clone this repo into `/home/pi` and setup the system according to `setup-system.sh` (haven't tested the script)

All files will end up in `/home/pi/timelapser/images`.

With a 32GB sd card you should be able to run the system for about 139 days give or take.
